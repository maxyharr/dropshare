        All group members have had solid experience in programming in multiple other
        languages, including Python, Java and C++. All three have experience with Ruby.
        We have ample knowledge of how to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With all
        of these factories together, this project is a very simple extension of our 
        current abilities. Nothing in the project is outside of our realm of work.
